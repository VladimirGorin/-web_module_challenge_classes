#  The _class_ Syntax

This challenge focuses on using the new for ES6 `class` syntax.

## JavaScript Fundamentals

## Objectives

- Student should be able to describe and demonstrate how class syntax works
- Student should be able to convert a pseudo classically instantiated program into class syntax

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:


1. Fork the repo
2. Go into canvas and connect your reop to codegrade
3. Clone your forked version of the repo
4. DO NOT CREATE A BRANCH. You will be pushing your changes to the main/master today
5. cd into your repo
6. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
7. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
8. Complete your work making regular commits to main/ master your codegrade score will update each time you make a push.


### Task 2 - MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until all of your tests pass.

**You can use yesterday's work to help you.** However, if you struggled a lot with that assignment, it is recommended that you attempt to re-write all code without "cheating" (peeking at yesterday's code or copy-pasting it).

If you run into trouble while coding, fight the good fight for 20 minutes and then get on the help channel. __Remember to formulate your help request in a professional manner__ - like you would at the job - by including error messages, screenshots, and any other pertinent information about the problem, as well as what things you have attempted already while trying to solve it.

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start`

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 3 - Stretch 

There are stretch goals found throughout `index.js`. Complete these after you have all of your tests passing for MVP!
